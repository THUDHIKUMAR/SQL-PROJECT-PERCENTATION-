# SQL-PROJECT-PERCENTATION-
This SQL-based project analyzes the Chinook digital music store database using MySQL. The goal is to extract business insights by performing advanced data queries on a relational schema containing 11 interconnected tables. Key entities include Customers, Employees, Invoices, Tracks, Albums, and Artists.

üîç Project Overview
The project uses a variety of SQL concepts:

Joins (Inner, Left) to combine data from related tables.

Subqueries to extract nested results.

Window Functions like RANK() and SUM() OVER() to perform analytics without losing row-level detail.

Date functions to calculate employee experience using TIMESTAMPDIFF.

üß† Key Insights & Queries
